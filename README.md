# Overview

The dataset I am analyzing comes from Kaggle, and is a public and free to use dataset holding information about the coffee market including opening and closing prices, and volume of coffee sold.
The dataset is stored in .json form and is interacted with using the Pandas and Numpy libraries within the python language.

I wrote this software to analyze the data because I wanted to see how coffee use has changed over the years, and to see how we as a society are using it. I created software that

# Data Analysis Results

I wanted to see how much the price, and volume of coffee had increased over the past 20 years, as those are both good reflectors of how coffee use increases over time.
Since January 2000 the price of coffee has increased more than 100$ from an initial price of 116$ to a current price of 222$ per ton.
Since January 2000 the volume of coffee sold has increased from a (monthly) average of 6,121 tons per day to a current (monthly) average of 16,291 tons per day.
The results I found show an overwhelming increase in the volume of coffee sold per day, and a large increase in the price. At a wholesale level, these values align with the law of demand, and show that we are currently at an all-time-high for coffee consumption.

# Development Environment

I used VScode to develop the software.

I wrote the software using python, and implemented the Pandas and Numpy python libraries to streamline the data analysis.

# Future Work

* Implement Kaggle API to keep the dataset constantly up to date
* Add functionality to reverse search through the dataset by any value to retrieve an associated value
* Add functionality to compare means/volumes of ranges with each other
